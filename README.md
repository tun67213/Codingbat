## Project Overview
This repository contains solutions to CodingBat problems implemented in both Java and Python.  
The purpose of this project is to strengthen problem-solving skills, reinforce programming fundamentals, and compare implementation approaches across languages.

Each language directory includes a `Main` file that serves as the entry point for executing and testing the implemented methods.
