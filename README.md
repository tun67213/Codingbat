## Project Overview
This repository contains solutions to CodingBat problems implemented in both Java and Python.  
The purpose of this project is to strengthen problem-solving skills, reinforce language fundamentals, and compare implementation approaches across languages.

Each language directory includes a `Main` file that serves as the entry point for executing and testing the implemented methods.

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tun67213/Codingbat.git
```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd Codingbat
```
