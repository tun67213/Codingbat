## Project Overview
This repository contains solutions to CodingBat problems implemented in both Java and Python.  
The purpose of this project is to strengthen problem-solving skills, reinforce language fundamentals, and compare implementation approaches across languages.

Each language directory includes a `Main` file that serves as the entry point for executing and testing the implemented methods.

## How to Compile and Run
For Java:
```bash
cd Java
javac Main.java
java Main
```
